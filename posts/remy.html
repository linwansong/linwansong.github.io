                        Remy was a ray-tracer that I built for my CS 488 Introduction to Computer Graphics 
                        final project in Fall 2019. I decided to add onto my Assignment 4 raytracer, which
                        was already capable of basic raytracing with meshes and primitives like spheres, cubes, 
                        cones, cylinders, and tori.

                                Reflection was fairly simple to add. I added a second type of material and calculated
                                the reflected ray based on the law of reflection.

                                Refraction can be calculated at the same time as reflection. Each 
                                material was given an index of refraction and the new rays were calculated 
                                based on Fresnel's equations.

                                I implemented stochastic anti-aliasing by sending out more rays per pixel, 
                                and then calculating pixel colour based on the average of the samples. 
                                Sample rays were generated using the halton sequence. The left image was 
                                generated without anti-aliasing, and the right was generated with anti-aliasing.

                                Texture mapping was implemented by projecting a 2d image onto 3d models.

                                Constructive Solid Geometry is a more advanced version of regular 
                                hierarchical modelling where boolean nodes are added, so that objects
                                can be subtracted from each other. Implementing this was surprisingly 
                                difficult, as it required a complete code re-factor.
