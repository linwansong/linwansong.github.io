      <description>I developed my first website way back in 2017, in a panic after I decided that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to find an internship without one. It was a horrendous thing, made up of cobbled together HTML and CSS that I got from a free Bootstrap template, but it was a webpage that displayed things, so I suppose it was good enough.&#xA;I was eventually employed (although I don&amp;rsquo;t think my site had anything to do with getting me that job) and I promptly forgot about this site.</description>
