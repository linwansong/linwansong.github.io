<time datetime=2023-06-11>Jun 11, 2023</time></div><br><br><p>I developed my first website way back in 2017, in a panic after I decided that I wasn&rsquo;t going to find an internship without one. It was a horrendous thing, made up of cobbled together HTML and CSS that I got from a free Bootstrap template, but it was a webpage that displayed things, so I suppose it was good enough.</p><p>I was eventually employed (although I don&rsquo;t think my site had anything to do with getting me that job) and I promptly forgot about this site. I only ever remember it existed when I looked at my github.</p><p>Then the pandemic happened, and I had some free time on my hands in between an internship and school. I scrapped the first site completely and I became determined to learn HTML and CSS. I managed to create, from scratch, the previous version of this site. I was much prouder of that one. It looked nicer, and I had done it all myself!</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t serviceable as a blogging platform though, and as the lazy CS major I am (or was), I was determined to A. Host my own blog B. Figure out a way to auto-generate it so I didn&rsquo;t have to write every last line of HTML by hand (or more likely, copy and paste into an HTML template). Enter Hugo.</p><p>I again found myself in between jobs last year, with nothing to do, so I decided to start building a statically generated site in earnest. I still didn&rsquo;t know much about web development, but I had free time to kill and I couldn&rsquo;t spend all of it playing Stardew Valley (as much as I wanted to), so away I toiled. I didn&rsquo;t get very far, though (mostly because I didn&rsquo;t know that the web browser was pulling from cache and not from my files every time it reloaded. The day I figured that out was the day my life changed. Ctrl-Shift-R is your friend).</p><p>Fast-forward to last December and I decided that 2023 was going to be the year I actually launched the blog I had spent so many years talking about. Work got in the way, and it&rsquo;s now June (oops), but it&rsquo;s live!</p><p>Happy Reading &lt;3</p></div><footer>Copyright (c) 2023 Linwan Song</footer></div></body></html>
