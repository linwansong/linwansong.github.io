        I developed my first website way back in 2017, in a panic after I decided that I wasn&rsquo;t going to find an internship without one. It was a horrendous thing, made up of cobbled together HTML and CSS that I got from a free Bootstrap template, but it was a webpage that displayed things, so I suppose it was good enough.
I was eventually employed (although I don&rsquo;t think my site had anything to do with getting me that job) and I promptly forgot about this site.
