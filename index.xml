It was a horrendous thing, made up of cobbled together HTML and CSS that I got from a free Bootstrap template, but it was a webpage that displayed things, so I suppose it was good enough.
I was eventually employed (although I don&amp;rsquo;t think my site had anything to do with getting me that job) and I promptly forgot about this site.</description></item><item><title>This Site!</title><link>http://linwansong.ca/projects/site/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://linwansong.ca/projects/site/</guid><description>The theme of this site was designed in Figma and written by hand. The blog itself is statically generated with Hugo.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure this site will ever be finished, so expect changes as time goes on. I will keep this project page updated as a changelog.
